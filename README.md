# AppBundler
### Wet Ferret Studios 2016

## General
This program is a personal experiment 
which will, when given the proper arguments,
allow you to create a .app file that will
launch however many apps you assign to it.
The idea is that once the apps are chosen,
the program will compile a C++ Executable
that will automatically open the chosen apps.
